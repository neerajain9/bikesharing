# Bikesharing
(Module 17 Challenge)

## Overview
We are pitching our Bikeshare business idea in Des Moines to our investors. The investors invest in people. They'd like to see how much work/research we have put into this proposal and whether it makes business sense or not. This presentation/analysis is a good starting point for us to begin engaging investors and potentially secure venture capital.

Out of curiosity, and to initiate the investor's attention we have started with the peak hours of the business. Execution is the key in any startup. And investors would like to ensure that the team is capable of executing. What are the areas of possible bottlenecks and what would it take to iron it out. Peak hours estimates our bike's overall inventory, maintenance, and any stanby inventory if at all need to be considered.


It is apparent that the following are some popular times when riders reach out for shared bikes.
1. Between 4:00 pm and 7:00 pm
   During this time people might be heading to commuter trains or getting back to their appartments after work.
1. Between 8:00 am and 9:00 am
   Our base assumption that people were mainly renting bikes to commute to work starts to make sense. During this time in the morning we see reasonable bike rentals. It is not as high as it is durng the evening hours but then many people prefer to take a walk in the morning.

### [Customer Demographics](https://github.com/neerajain9/bikesharing/blob/Data-Science/Resources/Gender%20Breakdown.png)

It is important to understand who is the potential user of our product/services. We have about 65% male riders, 25% female riders, and 10% unknown.

### [Duration of Trips](https://github.com/neerajain9/bikesharing/blob/Data-Science/Resources/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Users.png)

This is another important KPI. The investors would like to see the average duration of trips. This will help price the product/service offering. Also, this will be helpful in identifying bike maintanance, and inventory control.

### [Duration of Trips (by Gender)](https://github.com/neerajain9/bikesharing/blob/Data-Science/Resources/Checkout%20Times%20by%20Gender.png)

The breakdown by gender will also be reflected into our inventory and maintenance. We will have male & female bikes both and based on this analysis we can adjust inventory between the two. Also, female use the bikes with more care and may have lower maintenance.

### [Start & Stop Times](https://github.com/neerajain9/bikesharing/blob/Data-Science/Resources/Trips%20by%20weekday%20for%20each%20hour.png)
![](https://github.com/neerajain9/bikesharing/blob/Data-Science/Resources/Trips%20by%20weekday%20for%20each%20hour.png?raw=true)

Start & stop times has an impact on inventory management as well as maintenance schedule.

### [Start & Stop Times (by Gender)](https://github.com/neerajain9/bikesharing/blob/Data-Science/Resources/Trips%20by%20weekday%20for%20each%20hour%20(by%20Gender).png)

Although the peak times are consistent between male and female riders, however, the concentration of male riders is heavier than female riders.

### [User Trips by Gender](https://github.com/neerajain9/bikesharing/blob/Data-Science/Resources/UserType%20trips%20by%20gender%20by%20weekday.png)
![](https://github.com/neerajain9/bikesharing/blob/Data-Science/Resources/UserType%20trips%20by%20gender%20by%20weekday.png?raw=true)

Currently, we have two types of users; Subscribers & general users whom we call Customers. It is apparent that the usage is heavier within the Subscriber's community. We interpret Customers to be tourists or occassional riders. This is helpful in identifying the other pricing strategies and also to ensure the best usage of the resources i.e inventory.

## Summary
We think the analysis has broguht some very good point into the light that we totally ignored or didn't think about. 

Additionally, we ran analysis of user behavior by their age group and then broke it down by gender. It seems, bikeriding became very popular within the Subscriber's community and was most popular with males in their 90's. Millenials didn't seem to be very enthusiastic about riding the bike.

To test our hypothesis, we laid out the similar data with a different visualization. And we consider only Subscribers in this analysis. It seems userbase had been consistent across the gender as well as in the age group from 1950 - 2000.
